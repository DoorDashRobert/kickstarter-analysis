# Kickstarting with Excel - Module 1 Challenge

## The overview of the project was to invesitgate data and determine how differenet campaigned faired in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
Purpose is to provide Louise with a report that showcases the funding goals for each campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
Deliverable 1 ("Theater Outcomes by Launch Date") 
    An analysis was completed by utalizing the StarterBook data. Within the data I created a year column and extracted the year from the "date created conversion" column. Then pivoted the data and created a chart to reflect the number of successful, failed, and cancled projects by month. Once the chart was created a copy was saved (as png) in the resources folder.
Deliverable 2 ("Outcomes Basd on Goals") 
    An analysis was completed by creating a new sheet and adding 8 additional columns (Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Canceled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage Failed, Percentage Canceled). Then in the goal colume added the dollar amount ranges so that the projects could be grouped based on their dollar amount. Afterwards the countif formulat and the sum formaula were used to obtain the additional information. Once the data was calculated a line chart was created and saved as a png in the resources folder.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Within the first 5 months the Theater outcome had its most volume with its highest in month in May. Since then their was a steady decrease throughout the rest of the year
 ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges with Excel - most difficault part would be the written report.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 
    One conlusion you can have is that the month of May had its highest sucess thoughout the year. The second conslusion is that the failed count was extremly close to the sucess outcome in the month of October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
After review the goals were overal being met.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Goals are sqewed since the years are not utalized

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I believe a box plot graph for the goals would be smart
